	\subsection{Implement}
	For the implemented code see \texttt{src/representation.cpp}. As of now i pass all the small tests on codejudge, but I fail on the large set, with a "\texttt{Expected 0 but was 379}" error. 
	This is probably due to how I chose to print the result at the end, or how i handle equality collisions.
